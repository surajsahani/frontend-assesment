### Structure Notes

- `pages/` contains route components only; page-specific assembly happens here, while visual pieces stay inside `components/`.
- `components/Hero/` groups everything related to the Exercise 1 hero carousel so slider logic and presentation stay close together.
- `components/ProductCard/` isolates catalog UI for Exercise 1, making the grid and each card reusable and easier to test separately.
- `components/TabAccordion/` keeps the Exercise 2 responsive pattern together: `Tabs` for desktop, `Accordion` for mobile, and `TabAccordion` as the controller.
- `data/` stores mock content outside the UI so components stay presentation-focused.
- `styles/typography.css` centralizes repeated text styles using Tailwind `@apply`, which keeps JSX class lists shorter and more consistent.
- `utils/sanitize.js` is used before `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` so HTML content is filtered instead of rendered blindly.

## Component Architecture

### Component Structure

The project follows a component-based architecture to improve maintainability and reusability.

- `pages/` → route-level pages
- `components/` → reusable UI components
- `utils/` → helper functions
- `data/` → static JSON data

### Responsive Strategy

- Tailwind responsive utilities are used for layout adaptation.
- `useMediaQuery` switches between Tabs and Accordion layouts.
- `picture` element is used for responsive images.

### State Management

React local state (`useState`) is sufficient for this project scope and avoids unnecessary global state complexity.

## Data Sources

- **Exercise 1** reads from `slides.json` and `products.json`
- **Exercise 2** reads from `data.json`

## Hero / Slider

| Component       | Description                                                                           |

## Design Reference

Figma design used for implementation:

## Bonus

```js
("b" + "a" + +"a" + "a").toLowerCase() === "banana";
```

### Explanation

The expression works because JavaScript performs implicit type coercion.

- `+"a"` becomes `NaN`
- `"b" + "a"` becomes `"ba"`
- `"ba" + NaN` becomes `"baNaN"`
- `"baNaN" + "a"` becomes `"baNaNa"`
- `.toLowerCase()` becomes `"banana"`
